# File Match Mover

![alt text](https://github.com/stark4n6/File-Match-Mover/blob/main/file_match_mover.png)

This is a simple script that takes the following inputs:
- Text file input with a list of just file names (with extension)
- Source folder for input which will be recursively searched
- Destination folder for where any matching files from the text file and source folder will be files moved

*NOTE: I have only tested on Windows so your mileage may vary on other OS's*

## Requirements
You will need to install PySimpleGUI to run

`pip install PySimpleGUI`
